/* 
A tuple is a collection of objects which ordered and immutable. 
Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, 
the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use 
square brackets.

For example −
tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);

Tuples are immutable which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple elements.

To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a comma, even though there is only one value −
tup1 = (50,);

Removing individual tuple elements is not possible. There is, of course, nothing wrong with putting together 
another tuple with the undesired elements discarded.
