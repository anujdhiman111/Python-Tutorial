/* 
Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.
eg:- counter = 100  

Python has five standard data types :−
Numbers
String
List
Tuple
Dictionary

You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the del statement. The syntax of the del statement is −

del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]]
eg:-  del var1

Python supports four different numerical types −

int (signed integers)
long (long integers, they can also be represented in octal and hexadecimal)
float (floating point real values)
complex (complex numbers)

Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) 
with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 at the end.

The plus (+) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.

Python Lists:-
It is same as JS array but different from C array(It can store the  value of any data type).
The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) 
with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. 
The plus (+) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.

Python Tuples:-
 Tuples are enclosed within parentheses.
The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) 
and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated.

Python Dictionary
Python's dictionaries are kind of hash table type.
They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs.
	
int(x [,base])
Converts x to an integer. base specifies the base if x is a string.

tuple(s)
Converts s to a tuple.
	
list(s)
Converts s to a list.
	
set(s)
Converts s to a set.

dict(d)
Creates a dictionary. d must be a sequence of (key,value) tuples.
