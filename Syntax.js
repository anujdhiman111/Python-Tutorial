/*
Identifier:-
A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters,
underscores and digits (0 to 9).
Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers.

Indentation:-
Python provides no braces to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control.
Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.
The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount
Thus, in Python all the continuous lines indented with same number of spaces would form a block. 

Multi-Line Statements:-
Statements in Python typically end with a new line.
Python does, however, allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue.

Comments in Python:-
A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal begins a comment. 
All characters after the # and up to the end of the physical line are part of the comment 
and the Python interpreter ignores them.

Multiple Statement Groups as Suites:-
A group of individual statements, which make a single code block are called suites in Python.
